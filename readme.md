A little template to scaffold a console app with domain models and tests.

[Tutorial here](https://outragedpinkracoon.wordpress.com/2016/08/15/5-net-on-your-mac-scaffold-a-console-app-with-tests-and-domain-models/)

To update it to our own domain:
- Update namespaces
- Update class names
- Change the project.json file in each folder to point to your own namespace in dependencies (not MyCats.Domain etc)
